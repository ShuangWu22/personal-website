I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at [University of Caligornia, Los Angeles](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) after spending two years on graduate studies at [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Guang Cheng](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~guangcheng/) and extremely happy to collaborate with [Prof.Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue). My other collaborators include [Yuantong Li](https://liyuantong93.com/home/), [Chi-Hua Wang](https://muramiku999.notion.site/Chi-Hua-Wang-Ph-D-6f761ac5558d498cbb4b0a84d47a0a98) and Mingxuan Zhang etc. Before becoming a doctoral student, I received a BS in statistics from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://math.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2017 and a MS in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/biostatistics) in 2019. My general research interests are Trustworthy and Data-centric Machine Learning, Graph Machine Learning and Online Decision Making. My current research focuses on Graph Data Augmentation, Synthetic Data Generation and Bandit Algorithms.
