abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven exploration policy in bandit algorithms with bounded or unbounded rewards, called residual bootstrap exploration (ReBoot). 
  The ReBoot enforces exploration by injecting data-driven randomness through a residual-based history randomization mechanism. 
  This novel mechanism captures the underlying distributional properties of fitting errors, and more importantly boosts exploration to escape from suboptimal solutions (for small sample sizes) by assisting exploration level in an unconventional way.
  In theory, with appropriate exploration assistance, ReBoot provably secures instance-dependent logarithmic regret in sub-Gaussian multi-armed bandits. 
  We evaluate the ReBoot in different synthetic multi-armed bandits problems and observe that ReBoot is comparable to the Thompson sampling method.
